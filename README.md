Share sections of Youtube videos.

Advantages over YouTube Clip feature:

- There is no need to have a YouTube creator (google) account and to be logged in to create a clip.
- There is no 5-60 seconds restriction on clip duration. The clip can be however short or long you like.

Disadvantages:

- Does not work if the creator has deactivated embedding for the video.

Limitations:

- Does not work on Premiere and Live videos.
